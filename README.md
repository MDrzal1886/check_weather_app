# check_weather_app

This app is create to check weather in place which we enter.

## This app is build by create-react-app

I use only functions components with React Hooks like:

- useContext
- useState
- useEffect

To add styles i use Sass.

I get api from https://openweathermap.org/api by fetch method.
